# Various Works
## Duplicate MKV Deleter
Simple script written in Python which deletes all existing .mkv (Matro≈°ka) video files from a folder if a .mp4 video file of the same name exists. I used this to purge the video files that I had already remuxed into .mp4 using OBS, but just didn't delete at the time. Very effective at creating system storage space if you have a lazy habit of remuxing and not deleting .mkv files.
## Roblox Scripts
### Exploits
These are various scripts that I wrote when I was a lot younger (14-16), mainly for the Roblox game Elemental Battlegrounds. This served as my formative experience in learning how to script, and eventually program in general. I typically distributed these in obfuscated formats, but here they come in the original, raw format now, as the game is not nearly as popular now and thus I don't have an issue with publishing these here for historical and/or learning purposes. This of course doesn't feature every single script that I wrote, but only the ones that I believe were notable enough to include.

**ebgGUI.lua** - An exploiting hub that I began writing around October 2020 for Elemental Battlegrounds. Was notoriously the most powerful at the time and did not have any competitors for a while. Used a very, very bad whitelisting method, but I was a lot worse at cross-script communication back then.

**logUI.lua** - An April 2022 rewrite of ebgGUI.lua, which was made to demonstrate my improvements on programming since the time of the original. Comes in a differently styled appearance, and in general just works differently. Some minor features that were in the original are actually missing from this script (which is accidental), but they were not that important.

**autoServerCrasher.lua** - A script written in June 2021 which exploited a vulnerability in Elemental Battlegrounds having to do with a teleport move, which has since been patched. The script would freeze everyone's clients before hopping into another server and repeating the process. This was devastating, and largely prevented the game from being playable for a five-day timespan.

**anti_lag_for_lightning.lua** - A script which worked as an "antidote" of sorts against the aformentioned client-freezing exploit.

**ebgrainscape.lua** and **ebgsnowscape.lua** - Scripts that transformed the EBG standard map into different landscapes, rainy and snowy respectively. This script was made purely for aesthetic purposes.

**shiftlockicon.lua** - Changed the Roblox mouse icon to the shift lock icon. I found it as a better crosshair for me while playing the game, which is solely why the script was made.

**punchCracker.lua** - Script that bypassed the client-sided punching mechanisms on Elemental Battlegrounds, letting you punch under illegal conditions (like being safezoned, or while being stunned). This was probably my most favorite script to use of all of them.

**ebgfarm.lua** - A script that allowed players to farm their accounts in Elemental Battlegrounds. Had two different, configurable modes, along with lots of other options, and kept a statistics log of the gains made while farming. Written around late 2020.
